When recently meeting new people, I was asked how things were going. I mentioned one of my current odd hobbies, which surprised the individuals. One of my friends, however, just chuckled and said, "that's just Ben. Always learning something new." Audible is one of my tools for continual learning. So, I thought I would share a selection of titles this year.

<!-- more -->

## TL;DR

In 2014 I purchased 23 titles (see [my Audible 2014 experience](/diary/a-year-of-audible/)) and completed 188.3 hours of listening. I purchased 21 titles in 2015, completed 15 titles totaling 198.3 hours. I have 16 titles that I would like to listen to that total 199 hours. Therefore, I could go a year without buying another audible title and clear my library.

## Books Purchased in 2015

Below are the 21 titles I purchased in the past year through 30 November 2015. The **bolded** titles are those that I completed. There are three I did not start, and a few I gave up on at some point, which are struck-through.

My 2014 Audible goal was to listen to more fiction, which I sort of managed by listening to the Grimnoir series.

## Books Finished from 2014

There were 11 of 23 books from 2014 that were not completed. Three were finished in 2015

* Use of Weapons (13.5h)
* Steve Jobs  (25h)
* Bonhoeffer: Paster, Martyr, Prophet, Spy (22h)

I also re-listened to *Divine Conspriacy* (18h).

## Goals for 2016

At this point, I have a total of 50 titles, 44 listed. Of those, I have completed 27. There are five that I will not bother with. That leaves 16 that I need to finish, totaling 199 hours. I suppose I could go through more material, but my commute is short.

1. Red Team (11h)
2. History's Great Military Blunders (12h)
3. Writing Great Fiction (12h)
4. Rise & Fall (41h remain)
5. The Insurrents (15h)
6. Space Magic (8h)
7. God is the Gospel (6)
8. Institutes of Christian Religion (67h)
9. Long March (9h)
10. Threat Vector (18h)
