<!--Lead Paragraph-->
If there's a time in any marathon where there's a lull that could lead to defeat, a flag in energy, a desire to give up, then that would be March 2014.

<!-- more -->
But I won't give up. Not yet. It was a busy month. I'm still volunteer for a youth organization, and I'm feeling like I'm not quite doing there as well as I could, either. If half the job is showing up, then I'm half way there.

When you look at the [graph](/writing-logs/2014-progress), you'll see spurts of productivity followed by gaps of inactivity. From 16 to 22 March, that was because I was at a conference in California. I entered that week 4,176 words behind. I came out of that week ahead by 1,700 words. Living on the East coast, I kept getting up at the same time (2am PDT) and using those four hours to write. I also wrote on the flight back.

Most of that writing was on *Luctation*. Right now I'm at 52,100 words and tracking to be around 80,000 words. I am on scene 45 of 64, only four scenes from finishing Act III. At my daily goal of 410 words, then I have 54 days remaining until the draft is finished. If I stay on target, Luctation will be finished by 24 May&mdash;Memorial Day weekend.

I also had a chance to incorporate all of Dennis' *Bellicose* comments. He had over twenty pages of observations which had a minimal impact on the word count, but measurable improvement in the quality of the book. Over this past weekend, I uploaded to Createspace. The proof is in the mail and should be here this week. Assuming my final read goes well, then *Bellicose* will be released in April.

Not too bad for March?
