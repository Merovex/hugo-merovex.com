A man I respect recently lamented about how he is condemned as a Christian public figure for not doing all the right liturgical things. It made me reflect on King David, who despite all the heinous things he did was still beloved by God. The book [_David: Man of Prayer, Man of War_](https://amzn.to/2Ul6ZYp) by Walter Chantry provides perhaps the most humane description of David and his role with God.
