I'm finally in pre-production for *Bellicose*, the first of the Postal Marine Series. Last Fall, I published *[Scintilla](/books/)*, which was always meant to be the fourth of a series of five novels. I quickly plotted the second novel *[Luctation](/books/)*, a novel portraying Jonaldy, *Scintilla*'s villain as the hero. After grinding out 20,000 words, I felt that something wasn't quite right. Since then, I've been wrestling over how to proceed.

Over the past few weeks, I've been re-evaluating the series. By taking a step back and looking at the entire series, I was able to get a new perspective. I've started plotting *[Bellicose](/books/)*, which is essentially the creation story of the Postal Marine Series' major protagonist, Danel Bophendze. Having written the logline, I'm moving to the one-page plot synopsis. Wish me luck!
