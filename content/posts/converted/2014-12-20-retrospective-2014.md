When the day is at its shortest, it's time to look back at last year's progress. I accomplished more than I thought, but less than I had hoped.

## Progress in 2014

In my [Gutsy Year](/posts/a-gutsy-year) article, I observed that I posted once in 2013. I've posted over twenty times in 2014. One article every three weeks seemed to make sense, and yet I pulled out nearly one every-other week.

The table below shows the change in progress in 2014.


<div class="table-responsive">
<table class='table table-striped'>
  <tr><th>Book</th><th>2013 Status</th><th>2014 Status</th></tr>
  <tr><td><em>Bellicose</em></td><td>First Draft Done</td>
  	<td>Published 2014</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><em>Luctation</em></td><td>Stalled (25,516 words)</td>
  	<td>Drafted 2014</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><em>Imbroglio</em></td><td>Stalled (10,825 words)</td>
  	<td>42,921 words (as of Nov 2014)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><em>Scintilla</em></td><td>Published 2011</td>
  	<td>No Change</td>
  </tr>

## Plans for 2015?

I started writing this article in November, when I started putting together my [2015 writing goals](/posts/writing-goals-for-2015/). I set it at 100 <abbr title='kilowords or thousand words'>kwords</abbr>. However, while looking over my past year, I ran across my article on [revising my 2014 writing goal](/posts/july-lessons-in-transition/). In that article, I mentioned setting a three-year goal of four books. That goal requires a writing pace of about 110 kwords, or 300 <abbr title='Words per Day'>wpd</abbr>. Since I stated a four-in-three goal earlier, and the difference is a scant 10 kwords, I will try to stick to that goal.
