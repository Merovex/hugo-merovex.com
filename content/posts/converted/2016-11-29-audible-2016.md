---

I started audible because I thought I would have a long enough commute to listen to a lot of audio books. This past spring, my commute got longer. This is reflected in the higher completion rate of last year. I listened to 234 hours this year, 165 of those from books purchased this year, and 68 from the previous year. I typically listen at about twice narration speed, so actual listening time is closer to 140 hours. Since narrators target 125 words per minute, I consumed about 1.8 million words.

## Books Purchased in 2016

Below are the 27 titles I purchased in the past year through 30 November 2016, and a few from previous years that I worked on. The **bolded** titles are those that I completed. There are some I did not start or finish and are not counted regardless of how complete. There are a few I gave up on at some point, which are struck-through. There are other books that I returned and are not on this list.


3. [The Spirit of the Disciplines](http://amzn.to/2hZA9c5)
5. **[Red Team](http://amzn.to/2iamcst)**
6. **[Team of Teams](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Team-of-Teams-Audiobook/B00UVX3HRE)** 12.1h. The short book apparently wasn't enough.
7. **[Art of Public Speaking](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Art-of-Public-Speaking-Lessons-from-the-Greatest-Speeches-in-History-Audiobook/B00DIFFY6E)** 6.3h

9. [Leningrad](http://www.audible.com/pd/History/Leningrad-Audiobook/B00BNKAJCU) 15h. On my 2017 reading plan
10. [Absolute Surrender](http://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Absolute-Surrender-Audiobook/B002V8HCNM) 3.7h
11. [Wars of the Roses](http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Wars-of-the-Roses-Audiobook/B00OHX9OBW) 15.1h, partially complete.

13. [Multiply](http://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Multiply-Audiobook/B009ZOO116) 8.9h
14. [How Great Science Fiction Works](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/How-Great-Science-Fiction-Works-Audiobook/B01A1F8GSG) 12.5h
15. **[Your First 1000 Copies](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Your-First-1000-Copies-Audiobook/B00G3EHIAM)** 3h
16. **[Fierce Patriot: The Tangled Lives of William Tecumseh Sherman](http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Fierce-Patriot-Audiobook/B00LFVJQN0)** 15.1h. To understand one man, you need to understand his friends. I have more respect for both Grant and Sherman now I've heard Sherman's life.
17. [Enchantment](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Enchantment-Audiobook/B004QOUTUW) 4.8h
18. **[The First 90 Days](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/The-First-90-Days-Updated-and-Expanded-Audiobook/B00CDVYKUA)** 8h
19. **[Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Good-Strategy-Bad-Strategy-Audiobook/B006W15GVE)** 11.8h.
20. **[Cost of Discipleship](http://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/The-Cost-of-Discipleship-Audiobook/B002V8L1SE)** 9h. I look forward to chatting with Dietrich one day, but he's a tough listen.
22. **[Little Black Book of Invention](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/The-Little-Black-Book-of-Innovation-Audiobook/B006TCIVFE)** 6.1h
23. **[Plato's Republic](http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/Platos-Republic-Audiobook/B00DG67A0S)** 12.2h
24. [Holy Bible](http://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/The-Holy-Bible-Holman-Christian-Standard-Bible-HCSB-Audiobook/B00DWHRI94) 72.9h. I had a high aspiration to listen to the entire Bible with rapidity. Unfortunately, Plato got the better of me.
25. **[Sprint](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Sprint-Audiobook/B019R2DSDM)** How to take an idea to prototype in a week to support an MVP
26. **[Faith of Christopher Hitchens](http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/The-Faith-of-Christopher-Hitchens-Audiobook/B01D96LOPG)** 6.1h. An interesting narrative told by a Christian about one of the Four Horsemen. For all of his failings, Hitchens despised hypocrisy most of all and would turn on an atheist hypocrite to defend a sincere Christian.
26. <s>Seveneves<s> I gave up on this as the author openly advocates eugenics. I listened to 22.1h.
27. **[The Story of Medieval England](http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Story-of-Medieval-England-From-King-Arthur-to-the-Tudor-Conquest-Audiobook/B00DGBC6Y8)** 19.1h
28. **[World of Byzantium](http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-World-of-Byzantium-Audiobook/B00DJ8JAY2)** 12.2h Fascinating opening to more study into East Europe and that the Ottomans believed they were the legitimate successors of Rome.
29. [Daring Greatly](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daring-Greatly-Audiobook/B07DX9W2CG) There's a bit too much psychobabble in this, but the core of the story is to be comfortable operating outside your comfort zone and failing. That is where growth is.
30. [Digital to the Core](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Digital-to-the-Core-Audiobook/B017TEVNYQ)
31. [Never Split the Difference](https://www.audible.com/pd/Never-Split-the-Difference-Audiobook/B01CF5O89G) 8.1h
