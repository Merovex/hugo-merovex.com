It's that time of year again when people make resolutions. I typically make mine in October (birth month). I skim about 50-100 articles in my RSS feed daily, read maybe a dozen of them. Chris Brogan put out an interesting post about [summarizing your year in three words](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/my-3-words-for-2013/) that inspired me to summarize my 2013 goals. Part of that is to take on  [Amazon's writing challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20150108092708/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/how-to-submit-your-novel-in-the-new-year_b63061) suggested by Galleycat.

### Three Words in 2013: Write. Right. Lead. ###

**Go. To. Hell.** That certainly frames 2012. Wait, you wanted my 2013 words?

**Write.** I aspire to be self-publishing novelist. It sucks when my publisher (me) sends me a rejection letter. The goal
this year is to submit to the 2014 Amazon Novel challenge. Since that leads to a contract, I don't necessarily want to
win. I will, however, play to win.

**Right.** As a Christian and a father, I endeavor to improve my relationship
with God so that I can extend the effective range of his will.

**Lead.** I am in an influential role at home, work and my community. To lead I
must keep my wits about me in the myriad storms, chart a meaningful path that
others can follow, and exhort so that they will.

### Amazon's Writing Challenge ###

I'm going to tease out the "Write" word above as the big challenge for 2013.
Galleycat exhorted its readers on 31 December to "make a potentially life-
changing New Year's Resolution" by submitting one's novel to the *2013 Amazon
Breakthrough Novel Award Contest* (among others). As a self-publisher, I really
don't want to have a contract. I have a lot of different excuses, but it comes
down to wanting to exert control over my work, even if that limits the exposure,
quality or what-have-you.

But, submitting a novel for competition against 9,999 other aspiring authors has
a certain way of prodding me to finish Bellicose, which is just under 27,000
words now.

How would you summarize your 2013 goals in three words?
