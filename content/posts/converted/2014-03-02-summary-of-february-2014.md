<!--Lead Paragraph-->
February, 2014 has been one of those busy months where I felt like I got nothing done. Yet,
the month was on the whole productive.

<!--more-->
As you see the Daily Writing Progress, you'll see a lot of red, with several days of no or almost no activity. Work was tough, and I would come home and head right to bed. I'm involved in Trail Life USA, and there's a fair amount of time involved in that. I'm also working through a graduate certificate, which also takes a bit of time as well.

All the red was demoralizing. Somewhere about halfway through the month I decided I needed to see the year as a cumulative. That way, I could see progress, rather than a routine battering of how I was not keeping on track. I'm closing on 25,000 words for the year, which is pretty exciting. It's not the same as hitting 25,000 works during [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org), but it's a more sustainable pace. It's about 410 words/day, or about 2900 words per week. Two really productive (i.e., 1450 word) days and I could meet the goal.

This month my friend Dennis is giving *Bellicose* a more detailed read, finding all the typos and grammar mistakes I'm fond of making. He's been sending input that I need to incorporate some time in March if I hope to meet my goal of publishing in April. Donna Harriman Murillo, my cover designer, put the finishing touches on the *Bellicose* cover. I'm looking forward to engaging her to work on *Luctation*'s cover in April or May.

I've focused on drafting *Luctation* this month, all 10,000 words I wrote in February. This morning I started on the midpoint of the story. I'm at 40,000 words, and the novel is tracking at 80,000 words by the end of the draft. I tend to add during revisions, so it's working its way to the target of 85,000 words (about 255 pages). At this pace, the draft should be finished by mid-June. Then I'll pick up with *Imbroglio*. My goal is to finish the first four books of the *Postal Marine* Series this year.

Where did my other time go? There's a full week (19-24 February) on the graph were I put no words to paper. I spent that week building a new computer and getting the data transferred from my old one. Specifically, I built a Hackintosh for about forty percent of what a Mac Pro would cost. I'm only hanging onto Mac OSX for a couple games and [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com) at this point. Part of me is itching to return to Linux and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). If [Gimp's](http://www.gimp.org) UI could mature a little more, I then it could drop. I can live without games.
Perhaps when I get a bit further along with *Luctation* I'll dual boot this book and start weaning myself off of Mac.

After all, my original reason for getting on board with Mac was so I could use Scrivener, a tool that is very powerful but does not meet my needs.
