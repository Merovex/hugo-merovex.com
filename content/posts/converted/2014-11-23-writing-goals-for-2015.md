November is barely half-over and I'm making 2015's writing plans. This year has been very educational in terms of writing under something resembling a schedule. I'd like to make the most of it.

So why am I planning now? The entire notion of graphing came from [Jamie Rubin's writing progress activities](http://www.jamierubin.net/2014/11/16/how-i-used-rescuetime-to-baseline-my-activity-in-2014-and-set-goals-for-2015/). I don't pretend to be a master of the metrics. Jamie inspired me. Maybe it's because we're in the same state or are in the Information Technology market? You can see from my [2014 Progress](/posts-logs/2014-progress) how I managed. As of this writing, I'm a scant 83 <abbr title='kilowords or thousand words'>kwords</abbr> in, and highly unlikely to make my revised goal of 124 kwords.

What's my plan for 2015? I've already established my [2015 Progress](/posts-logs/2015-progress) page. At the time of this writing, it shows January 1 with nothing. It should populate in the next year "automatically." My goal is two write 104 days (4 days per week) at a pace of 1000 <abbr title='Words per Day'>wpd</abbr>. Rounding for mental sanity, that's 100 kwords.

What does this convert to in books? My novel target length is 80 kwords, so that's one new book in 2015. *[Luctation](/books/#luctation)* and *[Imbroglio](/books/#imbroglio)* are not yet complete, so part of 2015 will involve revisions. All four books need the more-professional editing that I've committed to. Twenty-fifteen will be a busy year on the back-end of production.

The perfect scenario is two books in 2015. That would be one from the Postal Marine Series, and a book from my next series. That's between 150&ndash;160 kwords. Since I've not proven that ability in 2014, I'm not going to commit to it in 2015.

So what am I going to write in 2015? With four books written in Postal Marines, it will be time to try a book in a new series.
