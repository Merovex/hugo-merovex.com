For decades, Amazon customers have relied upon the five-star rating. Some authors live and die by them. The problem with this rating model is that it fails to tell an informative story.

The use of [stars to classify books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_%28classification%29) goes back over 100 years, although the use of star-rating goes back nearly 200 years. When created, it was a simple means of comparing two similar items.

We now have a more sophisticated understanding of metrics. The metric most often used in the venture capital world is the [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter). Traditionally used, this 10-point rating system culls the audience into Promoters, Detractors and Neutrals. You may see use of this in airports where they ask you how you would rate the experience. In those cases, they only ask on a three-point scale, Smile, Frown or Meh.

Net Promoter can be used with the Amazon 5-star. The scoring system simply subtracts the percentage of Detractors in the reviewing population from the percentage of Promoters. The score could therefore range from -100 to 100. With Amazonâ€™s system, the Detractors are the 1- to 3-stars and the Promoters are the 5-stars. I use this method when I shop.

This method helps identify whether those who have purchased it would recommend it to someone else. In the case of Bellicose, the score is -6 at time of this writing. That said, unless you have more than 30 data points, the system tends to break down.
