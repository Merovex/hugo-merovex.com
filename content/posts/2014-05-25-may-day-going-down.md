description: May was a rough month, but hope remains.

The promise of finishing a novel before me, May was not the month I hoped it would be.
<!--more-->

I decided to publish this article well ahead of the end of the month. With six days remaining in May, I have a chance to reverse some of what I say here. After a mostly dead month, today was hopefully the start of the reverse. I am currently at 2,105 words for the day. My wordcount deficit when I started was 5,442. So, I'm at 3,337 words behind schedule. If I could get to 2,700 words, then I would nearly halve my deficit. But, remembering that every day I dig the hole 410 words deeper, I would need 3,131 words to be at half.

I'm going to say I sort of cheated. The goal for the year is 150,000 words. Until this month, the graph has been showing a daily target of 500 words. I reran the graph script using 410 words, which turned a chronic debt into a chronic surplus. What can I say? I live in Northern Virginia and have learned from the greats on how to make statistics paint happy pictures.

What's the excuse this time? In February I built a hackintosh. I sat there smugly looking at a powerful computer for half the cost. I reported in April how it crashed and I lost time getting it operational. It crashed again on 10 May. It was not until the night of 23 May that I had recovered enough that I could write. My solution was to break down and buy a MacBook Air. In the past I had been running Mac Minis, which had all of the power of a laptop with all of the portability of a desktop. I thought with the hackintosh I would address the power issue. Instead I addressed the portability issue. Which meant that today I was able to write in the backyard while the kids played, and in the dining room while the family slept.

Where am I? I'm well into the last act of *Luctation*. Both Jonaldy and Creed are in the last bit of their race and it's going to be a close one. Nine segments left until I'm finished. Then I'll put it on the shelf to cool as I turn to *Imbroglio*, the book that started it all. I've not been in the mood to read *Bellicose* and see where it stands. If I can get the proof read and approved then I'll publish it.
