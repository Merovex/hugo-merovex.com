It has been a while since I updated what I've been listening to on Audible. I assure you it is not because I went deaf. To make up for lost time I will share what I listened to since 2016. As I built the list, I could remember where I was when listening to specific books. For example, the _Phoenix Project_ through _Toyota Way_ were when we were in an apartment in the Summer of 2017 transitioning between our homes. I remember listening to _Elon Musk_ while mowing cleaning the old backyard in Spring 2017. (The book lists are all reverse chronological order.)

When do I listen? When driving, usually by myself. I also listen when doing yard work that requires no thought. Now that our oldest is cutting grass, I think I'm listening to fewer books.

## Audible 2019

In the interests of brevity, I will list only those titles that I completed in 2019. This is only January through September since I am trying to get back to posting this list every October/November. The _Last Lion_ is a trilogy on Winston Churchill. Other books (_Scratch of a Pen_, _The Men Who Lost America_) support research for a novella series I am contemplating that is set in the 18th Century. _The Cleaner_ is fiction, and the other titles are productivity or business related.

## Audible 2018

In the interests of brevity, I will list only those titles that I completed in 2018. This year, I completed 210 hours of audiobooks. Meditations is an estimate since the title has since been removed from Audible. This year was rather interesting, with the usual mix of business and productivity and a few fiction titles. I was exploring Rome a bit, with the thought of a fiction series around a similar empire or the like. More faith-related titles this year than in 2019.

## Audible 2017

In the interests of brevity, I will list only those titles that I completed in 2017. This year, I finished 265 hours of audiobooks. Almost all of this year is productivity related. I have a life-goal of a biography for every president, so I knocked out Nixon and some of Johnson. We don't give Nixon credit for positive change in race relations he pushed, and we don't damn Johnson enough for the reverse. _Watership Down_ was to follow along with the book with my son who was reading it for school.
