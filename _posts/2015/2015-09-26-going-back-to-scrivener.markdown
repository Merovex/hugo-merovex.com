<!--Lead Paragraph-->

I've discussed my [author's toolchain](/technology/toolchain/) before. This week, I find myself drawn back to Scrivener. I'd like to explain why.

<!-- more -->

When it comes to the right tool, I am a nomad. I have tried paper, wikis, Evernote, etc. It's quite a bit disjointed. Ultimately, my mind has been the central repository for all things. When I suggest a tool to peers who are writing, I invariably recommend Scrivener to them, adding that I'm too cool for it myself.

When it comes to [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), I have my reservations. It doesn't give me the control that I want at the point of production. But, there are a few things it offers that merits a second look.

It offers me a chance to collocate all the novels, the series bible and novel bible all in one location. If you look at the screenshot accompanying this article, you see that I am fleshing out a master project that covers everything. In the past, I stated a desire for an index, such as list of characters, etc. However, I can use internal document links, which affords the same thing. I have other desires, most of which are possible in Scrivener. I think I also gain access to [Aeon Timeline](http://www.aeontimeline.com/) and [Scapple](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php).

I lose a few things dear to me. I am binding myself to a vendor, which I don't have with my current toolchain. I believe I lose some quality when compiling my work. But, with this I gain the metadata capabilities I'm trying to emulate via other means.

So what are my next steps? The screenshot shows I'm putting together a format for a master series project comprising books. One of my earlier works was in Scrivener, but I will need to take time to get all of my works into Scrivener. I'll start with my current edit of *Luctation*, which allows me to move each section and edit in turn.
