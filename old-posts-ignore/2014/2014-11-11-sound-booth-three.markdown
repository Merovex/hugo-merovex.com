A few months back I talked about building a Voice-Over booth. After much research and analysis, I'm finally ready to press the button.

It started with an ambitious plan to [add audio recordings](/technology/so-im-building-a-vo-sound-booth/) to my novels. Then I [whittled the plan back](/technology/so-im-building-a-vo-sound-booth-2/) a bit in late August. Why would I do such a thing? Because there are many people who lack time for reading (I'm one of them). There are also many people who are visually impaired such that they cannot read. So Audible sounded like a great idea.

Hubris set in, and I thought I could build my own booth. I figured, "Heck, I can learn this. After all, it's just talking, right?" Over the past two weeks, I had three encounters that had me think differently. I'll list them in reverse order of importance.

* Dirk Benedict, of all people. He did an interview that brought my expectations back down to earth.
* James Scott Bell, in *[How to Make a Living as a Writer](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P1JGD8I)* talked about Stephen King doing voice-over for his own book. (See at 226.)
* A blind colleague praised the notion of recording audiobooks...and how horrible Stephen King's narration is.

In the words of a great philosopher, "Man's got to know his limitations." King's a great writer...but to my friend he's a bad narrator. I don't even know if I'm a good writer...I'm a self-avowed poor writer. So why should I think I an narrate?

I would like to think I wrote a decent novel. Over the past few months, I have witnessed the power of a good cover. Based on feedback from early readers, I'm recognizing the power of a good edit. In both cases, I did not let my pride prevent me from finding professionals. So, why should I not be pursuing a professional narrator?

I still want to get my works into the hands of those who don't have time or ability to read. So I'll be going to Amazon's Creation Exchange.
